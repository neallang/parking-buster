# Parking Buster

Welcome to Parking Buster, the reporting app for bad parking! This project was written in Django and uses some cool features such as Google Auth login, Amazon S3 file storage, CSS/HTML, and more to make it a complete and visually appealing application. It was being hosted on Heroku using PostgreSQL but recently was shut down due to cost and practicality (lack of). I really enjoyed working on this project as the DevOps manager and would love to talk more about it for anyone interested. I also have published pictures of the general layout on my portfolio!
